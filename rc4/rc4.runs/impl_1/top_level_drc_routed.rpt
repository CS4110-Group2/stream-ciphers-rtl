2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net control_path/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin control_path/reg_tmp_select_reg_i_1/O, cell control_path/reg_tmp_select_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net control_path/ram_address_select_reg[1]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin control_path/ram_address_select_reg[1]_i_1/O, cell control_path/ram_address_select_reg[1]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net uart_rx/FSM_onehot_state_reg_reg[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin uart_rx/reg_j_select_reg_i_1/O, cell uart_rx/reg_j_select_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
